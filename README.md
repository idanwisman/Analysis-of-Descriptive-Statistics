# Analysis Of Descriptive Statistics
Used Google Sheets to compare financial sectors with visualizations.

This project contains one file that summarizes findings with a link to the sheets.

In this project I was comparing two financial sectors in the NYSE and created a dynamic P&L statement which allows selection of a company and year from a list to get the statement.

I also created a future forecast according to the previous performance of the company.
